## 0. Problem Statement and Solution

**Problem Statement:**  
Users today rely on multiple separate platforms such as Steam, MyAnimeList, Seneca Blackboard and other personal task apps to track their entertainment, hobbies, and productivity. Constantly switching between these tools causes disorganization, wasted time, and difficulty maintaining focus on daily goals.  

**Proposed Solution:**  
Our solution is a **unified web dashboard** that aggregates data from external APIs while allowing users to manage personal tasks, notes, and timers in one customizable interface. The goal is to create a seamless, privacy-conscious, and responsive platform that simplifies how users monitor progress and productivity across all their activities.
