# Activity Tracker Web App

A web-based application built using **React.js** and **Node.js** that helps users track their activities, hobbies, and productivity tools in one centralized dashboard. Users can link external accounts like **Steam**, **MyAnimeList (MAL)**, and potentially **Spotify** to view all their activity data in one place.

The goal of this project is to combine entertainment tracking and personal productivity into a single, easy-to-use web app.
