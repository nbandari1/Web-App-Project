# Business Proposal – Unified Activity Tracker Web App  
**Team Name: Team 4**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Title:** Unified Activity Tracker (UAT)  
**Value Proposition:** A single web platform that consolidates your digital life — gaming, anime, music, tasks, and notes — into one clean, customizable dashboard.

**Summary:**  
People use multiple platforms daily (Steam, MyAnimeList, Spotify, etc.), but there’s no unified place to view their activity, track progress, or manage personal tasks. Our project proposes a web application that integrates these services into one centralized dashboard. Users can track their gaming hours, anime progress, music listening habits, personal tasks, sticky notes, and timers — all in one place. The goal is to reduce digital clutter and help users stay organized without switching between apps.

**Team Members & Roles:**  
- Nishnath Bandari : Team Lead, Backend Dev
- Nisarg Jaswal : Frontend Dev, UI Designer
- Ryan Tersigni : Backend Dev
- Mattrey Kumar : Frontend Dev

## 3. Project Overview & Background

**Inspiration:**  
Most people juggle multiple platforms daily. Gamers track achievements on Steam, anime fans update MAL, music lovers use Spotify, and everyone uses separate apps for tasks, notes, and timers. Switching between all these creates friction and wastes time. We wanted a single place where everything comes together.

**Background & Research:**  
- The average person uses 10–30 apps per month, and app switching is a major productivity drain (Simform, 2023).  
- Steam has over 120 million monthly active users, and MAL has over 20 million registered users, showing a massive audience for activity tracking platforms.  
- Productivity tools like Notion and Todoist are popular, but they don’t integrate entertainment activity tracking.

**Existing Solutions & Gaps:**  
- Notion/Trello → Great for tasks, but no entertainment integrations.  
- Steam/MAL/Spotify dashboards → Only track their own platform, not others.  
- Habit trackers → Don’t integrate with user activity data.

**What’s Missing:**  
A unified, customizable dashboard that blends entertainment activity with productivity tools.

## 4. Problem Statement & Stakeholders

**Problem:**  
Users have fragmented digital lives across multiple platforms. There is no centralized place to track entertainment activity, personal tasks, and productivity tools together.

**Stakeholders:**  
- Gamers who want to track playtime, achievements, and backlog.  
- Anime/Manga fans who track progress on MAL or Anilist.  
- Music listeners who want insights into listening habits.  
- Students & professionals who need tasks, notes, and timers.  
- General users who want a clean, unified dashboard.

**Why It Matters:**  
- Constant app switching reduces focus and productivity.  
- Users want personalized dashboards that reflect their actual daily habits.  
- Entertainment and productivity are often intertwined — people want to manage both in one place.

**Evidence:**  
Studies show that reducing context switching improves productivity and reduces cognitive load. A unified dashboard directly addresses this need.

## 5. Objectives

### Primary Goals:
1. Build a web app that integrates Steam, MAL, and Spotify APIs into a single dashboard.  
2. Provide productivity tools:  
   - Task manager  
   - Sticky notes  
   - Pomodoro-style timer  
3. Allow users to customize their dashboard layout and widgets.  
4. Provide analytics (e.g., weekly gaming hours, anime episodes watched, music stats).  
5. Ensure secure login, data syncing, and responsive UI.

### Success Metrics:
- Successful API authentication and data retrieval from at least 3 platforms.  
- Users can create, edit, and delete tasks/notes.  
- Timer functions reliably with session tracking.  
- Dashboard loads under 2 seconds.  
- Positive user feedback from testing (4/5 satisfaction score).

### Deliverables:
- Fully functional web app  
- API integration modules  
- Dashboard UI with widgets  
- Documentation + demo video  
- Final presentation

## 5. Why This Is a Substantial Two Semester Project

### Scope & Complexity:
This project involves multiple challenging components that require time, iteration, and testing:

**Major Features:**  
- Multi platform API integration (Steam, MAL, Spotify)  
- User authentication system (OAuth + custom accounts)  
- Customizable dashboard with draggable widgets  
- Real time data syncing  
- Task manager, notes, and timer tools  
- Analytics engine for activity insights  
- Responsive UI across devices  

### Why It Needs Two Semesters:
- API integrations require careful handling of rate limits, authentication, and data parsing.  
- Dashboard customization and widget system require complex frontend engineering.  
- Backend must support user profiles, settings, and synced data.  
- UI/UX design needs multiple iterations and user testing.  
- The analytics system requires data modeling and visualization.  
- The team needs time for documentation, testing, and polishing.

### Value Delivered:
- A unique, centralized productivity + entertainment hub.  
- A tool that genuinely improves digital organization.  
- A technically impressive project demonstrating full stack development, API integration, and UI/UX design.

## 6. Risks & Challenges

### Potential Risks:
- API limitations or changes (Steam/MAL/Spotify).  
- OAuth authentication complexity.  
- Scope creep from adding too many integrations.  
- Performance issues with real time syncing.  
- Team workload balancing across semesters.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Start with 1–2 APIs, expand later.  
- Use modular architecture for integrations.  
- Set strict feature priorities per semester.  
- Conduct regular sprint reviews and testing.  
- Maintain clear documentation and version control.
